###Lorax Version###
I made the previous version of the Dunce Tracker for my own purposes. I usually have a big project to work on, and need to break up the bulk into smaller tasks.

However, other people I work with need to track much smaller tasks, but at a larger scale. 

It's become 1 massive project vs. many many small projects.

This version, the Lorax version, will be a step in the final design of the project, as well as an alternative way to track tasks.
